Scripture Verse Popup Preview lets you see Bible verses instantly while you browse. Select any Bible reference on a webpage (e.g. “John 3:16” or “Romans 12:1-2”) and a popup shows the verse text in your chosen translation.

**What it does**

• **Verse preview on selection** — Highlight a reference (single verse, range, or full chapter) on any site. A popup appears with the scripture text.

• **Copy button** — Copy the displayed verse text (including the reference and translation name) to your clipboard for notes, messages, or documents.

• **Context button** — Open the current passage’s chapter on Bible Gateway (biblegateway.com) in a new tab, so you can read the full chapter in the same translation.

• **Multiple translations** — Switch between ESV, KJV, ASV, WEB, NKJV, NASB (and others) in the popup. Set a default in Options.

• **Toolbar lookup** — Click the extension icon to type a reference and view the verse without selecting text on a page.

• **Options** — Set your default translation and, if you use ESV or NKJV/NASB, your own API keys (stored locally). No account or keys required for KJV, ASV, or WEB.

• **Privacy** — No personal data or browsing history is collected. API keys and preferences are stored only in your browser.

By installing, you agree to use the extension in line with the Chrome Web Store Program Policies.
